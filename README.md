# Implementation of IRAGN with manual gradients' derivation.

I derived the details of the algorithm **IRGAN: A Minimax Game for Unifying Generative and Discriminative Information Retrieval Models**, and implemented it without automatic derivative tool like TensorFlow.

## Explanation
- ml-100k: MovieLens 100K dataset and pre_trained generator.
- pre_train: Pre_train method for the generator.

## How to start?
	python Main.py
